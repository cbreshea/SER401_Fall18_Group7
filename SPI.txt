Using SPI:
	If a project requires SPI it is likely using the arduino library SPI.h. If a project is using SPI it will require 4 digital pins.
	These pins will be for MOSI(Master Out Slave In), MISO(Master In Slave Out), SCK(Serial Clock), and SS(Slave Select)
	Alternatively the user can instead use the ISCP header for SPI communication and on certain boards like the Leonardo this will be required.
	If this is the case then nothing needs to be accounted for as this header is included on every board as it is used to load programs onto the board.

Detecting if SPI is required:
	This can be done by searching for SPI.h or SPI.begin() in the source code of the project.
