//Overview
	*	Linker script generates map file
	*	A linker takes several input files and combines their contents to make 
		a single output file.
	*	Useful for determining how memory is being mapped to determine 
	 	optimizations or size restricitons
	*	Different linker spripts are used depending on if the program is
		stored in Flash or RAM

//Linker Script terms
	*	object file- every input file is considered an object file
	*	executable- the output file
	*	input section- a portion of an input file
	*	output section- a portion of the output file
	*	VMA- Virtual memory address, address of an output section when the
			 output file is run
	*	LMA- Load memory address, the address used to load the section

	SECTIONS							(LINE 1)
{
  . = 0x10000;							(LINE 2)
  .text : { *(.text) }					(LINE 3)
  . = 0x8000000;						(LINE 4)
  .data : { *(.data) }					(LINE 5)
  .bss : { *(.bss) }					(LINE 6)
}

	*Line 1: Says the the SECTIONS command is being used. Proceeding lines declare the values of the symbols associated with SECTIONS
	*Line 2: Gives the address in memory of where the code should be loaded.
	*Line 3: Indicates that all text in the input files are output
	*Line 4: Indicates the address where data will be outputted too
	*Line 5: Outputs the data to the 0x8000000 address in memory.
	*Line 6: Outputs the bss at the end of the data output.
