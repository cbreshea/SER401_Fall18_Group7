Identifying pins that are being used for PWM
Pulse width modulation is done in arduino code using the analogWrite() method.
This method takes two input the first being the pin and the second being the value

To figure out what pin is recieving the outputted value of the PWM look at the first value passsed in to analogWrite().

PWM can also be identified by the OCR2A and OCR2B which are used to enable Fast PWM
