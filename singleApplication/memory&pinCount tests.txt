To compile the singeApplication program use the following command. This compiles an executable with the name singleApplication.
the std=gnu++11 option is required for the json library to be usable.

 g++ -std=gnu++11 singleApplication.cpp -o singleApplication

run: singleApplication [memory size(bytes), pin count]
