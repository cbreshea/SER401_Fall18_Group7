This program uses an external JSON parser called nlohmann. Make sure the json.hpp file (which you can get from the nlohmann GitHub page) is in the same directory as your main program. In your program, make sure you have #include "json.hpp". 

To Compile make sure to use -std=c++11 as a flag for g++
