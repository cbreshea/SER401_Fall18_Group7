Differences between ATMEGA4809 and microcontrollers less advanced than it:
	*ATmega4809 is used in the Atmega4809 xplained pro and the upcoming Arduino wifi rev 2
	*The 4809 is unique in that it supports peripheral multiplexing
	*peripheral multiplexing gives developers the ability to move peripherals around to other pins to avoid conflicts
	*peripheral multiplexing on the 4809 means that just becuase a funtionality is being used on a 4809 we can't tell which pin is being used
		*we do however still know that the funtionality being used and the number of pins assoiciated with that funtionality.
			*i.e pin requirement: SPI > UART
