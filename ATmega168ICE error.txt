Day 2 attempting to figure out Atmel ICE:
	known: 
		*ATmega168 is compatible, but it does change defualt fuses on 168 making it no longer work with AVR programmer.
		*Atmel studio 7 handles most of the ICE setup I.E fuses
		*Atmel studio 7 was installed before configuring ICE, so setting should for the most part be correct
		*the MCU is recieving power
		*instuctions for this are TERRIBLE
	Unknown:
		*if the ICE is connected correctly. The red and green lights are on. Just green is supposed to be on?
		*Do the 168 fuses need to be changed even more? changed to what? MCU dependent?
