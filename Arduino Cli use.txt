Known working version: 0.3.3-alpha.preview

found at: https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli

Scroll down to the How to Install section and select the windows hyperlink to download the latest alpha or use tags to download a previous version if a new version is released.

Once downloaded place the executable into a folder that is in the PATH environment variable and rename it to something shorter such as arduino-cli.

After downloading you need to update the core index by typing:

	arduino-cli core update-index

If this fails you can likely run he command again to complete it.

Next you will need to install a core so that the cli can compile a sketch for a specific board.

Example: arduino-cli core install arduino:avr

Core installs can timeout so you might have to run the command again to complete the download and install.

Finally you can compile your sketch by entering the command:

	arduino-cli compile -b [board] [sketch name]

	Example arduino-cli compile -b arduino:avr:uno Blink

The file created from this sketch will be placed in the same folder that the arduino ide does. Remember that for windows this is under user/AppData/Local/Temp/arduino-sketch-[long hashcode]

If you have issues with compilation or want to use other commands use arduino-cli help to see the list of commands available and use arduino-cli [command] -h to get help with a specific command.
